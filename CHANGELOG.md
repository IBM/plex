## [Unreleased]

- IBM Plex Sans CN
- [IBM Plex Mono] Addition of glyphs /currency /prime /primedbl
- Allow more granular selection of font-families and weights [#329](https://github.com/IBM/plex/issues/329)

# Plex v5.2.0

## IBM Plex Sans JP

### Added

- CSS stylesheets: `css/ibm-plex-sans-jp.css` and `css/ibm-plex-sans-jp.min.css`
- Sass entrypoint: `scss/sans-jp/index.scss`

The upcoming major release will make chosing specific font-weights and languages easier for developers. Until then, enjoy IBM Plex Sans JP!

# Plex v5.1.0

## IBM Plex Sans KR Styles

### Added

- CSS stylesheets: `css/ibm-plex-sans-kr.css` and `css/ibm-plex-sans-kr.min.css`
- Sass entrypoint: `scss/sans-kr/index.scss`

Rendering CJK fonts performantly on the web requires many more subsets than western languages. These additional subsets result in many more `font-family` declarations. Adding these declarations to the currently generated stylesheet would cause it to double in size.

For this reason, we've split `IBM Plex Sans KR` off into it's own style sheet. In the future, we'll be exporting similar stylesheets per-language so developers can chose inidividual languages to suit their users.
